## Additional Notes
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for API requests and database interactions to handle edge cases gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to users.
- **Security Measures:** Consider implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, especially if this API will handle sensitive data. Use techniques like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth for secure access.
- **Validation:** Ensure input validation for user-provided data to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or malicious inputs.
- **Scalability:** Plan for scalability by optimizing database queries, using indexes, and considering potential bottlenecks in the system architecture.
- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation for future reference and easier onboarding of new developers who may work on this project.
- **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to validate the functionality and performance of the API endpoints.
- **Logging:** Implement logging mechanisms to track errors, monitor system behavior, and analyze usage patterns for improvements.
- **Versioning:** Consider versioning the API endpoints to manage changes and maintain backward compatibility for existing clients.
- **Code Review:** Encourage code reviews to ensure code quality, adherence to best practices, and identify potential issues early in the development cycle.
- **Performance Optimization:** Continuously optimize the codebase, database queries, and frontend interactions for better performance.
- **Community Support:** Leverage community resources, forums, and platforms for support, updates, and addressing potential issues in the tech stack used.
